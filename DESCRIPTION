Title: Read FreeSurfer Neuroimaging File Formats
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Tim Schäfer

Description: Provides functions to read data from neuroimaging files in FreeSurfer binary formats. This includes the following file formats: 1) MGH/MGZ format files, which can contain multi-dimensional images or other data. Typically they contain time-series of three-dimensional brain scans acquired by MRI. They can also contain vertex-wise measures of surface morphometry data though. 2) FreeSurfer morphometry data files in binary 'curv' format. These contain one value per vertex for each vertex of a brain surface. These are typically values like the cortical thickness or area at each vertex.
